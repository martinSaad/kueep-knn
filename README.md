# kueep ML using KNN

## WHAT THIS CODE DOES?
this is java code in order to classify a specific product (cellphone) into corresponding profile.

## HOW IT WORKS?
the knn alogrithm uses traning data in order to classify something.
our training.arff contains 4 different values with different kind of attributes, i.e: company, storage, os, etc.
than we have the "data.arff" which contains the value we want to predicit, using the '?' sign on the calssify attribute.

## HOW TO RUN?
just hit the run command on Main class.
you can change the values on "data.arff" if you want to classify different product.
